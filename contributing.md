Awesome Taichi contributing.md 

Awesome Taichi is a collection of quality demos created by Taichi Lang users. We'll update this repo regularly, and you are strongly encouraged to share your work with us!

**Components of Awesome Taichi**
Awesome Taichi currently consists of two sections: applications and courses. The former part is subdivided by application scenario, such as machine learning, mathematics, simulation, rendering, physical optics, and voxel art.

**Entry threshold **
- Your repository must have a complete README.md file that provides a thorough description of your demo. We suggest that you include the following: 
  - What effects you want to achieve;
  - A visualization of computational results;
  - A brief explanation of the principles of the implementation.
- Your code files (.py) can run on the latest version of Taichi.
- The major workload of computation is completed by Taichi.
- A requirements.txt file should be attached to remind viewers of all the dependencies and libraries used in your demo.

**How to submit your work to Awesome Taichi**
- Submit a PR to the taichi-dev/awesome-taichi repo, explaining what your demo is about and choosing the appropriate application scenario it belongs to. 
- We will review your PR within one week and merge it if your work satisfies our criteria. 
- We will leave a message to you if your work is not selected, and you can close your PR.
